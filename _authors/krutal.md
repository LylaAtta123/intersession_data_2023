description: I am currently an undergraduate junior studying Applied Mathematics and Statistics, and Computer Science at Johns Hopkins University. I am interested in research in Computational Graph Theory and Statistical Modeling. I am also a current Data Scientist Intern at The Applied Physics Laboratory. I am excited about pursing a career in Data Science and Analytics post graduation. In my free time, I like to swim, play volleyball, and run.
