description: Hi! I'm a freshman biomedical engineering student currently interested in the cell and tissue engineering and maybe also imaging and medical devices focus areas! In my free time, I love to hang out with my friends, try new restaurants, and play with my dog! I'm really passionate about data science and look forward to learning more in this class!
