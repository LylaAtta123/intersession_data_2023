B) Petal length (cm) correlated with petal width (cm) of three Iris species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica. Data analyzed with R and box plot used. Setosa has the smallest petal length and smallest petal width. Versicolor has the second largest petal length and petal width. Virginica has the largest petal length and the largest petal width.

C) Sepal length (cm) correlated with sepal width (cd) of three Iris species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica. Data analyzed with R and a box and whisker plot used to show distribution of data. [ADD MORE?]
