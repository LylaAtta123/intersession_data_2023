Figure 1: Comparisons of flower sepal and petal sizes with sepal and petal lengths or flower species. A) Sepal width (cm) vs. sepal length (cm) of 3 different flowers (see legend in 1B). B) Petal width (cm) vs. petal length (cm) of 3 different flowers. C) Sepal length (cm) vs. flower species. This figure uses the same data as 1A, but separates the 3 flowers into box and whisker plots, with a star on the line that spans 2 plots indicating a statistically significant difference. Two-sided T-tests were used to determine statistical significance. D) Petal length (cm) vs. flower species. This figure uses the same data as 1B, but, as with 1C, separates data based on flower species and uses a two-sided T-test to determine statistical significance.
