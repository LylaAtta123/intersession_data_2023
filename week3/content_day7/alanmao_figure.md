*Figure 1.* A comparison of the dimensions of sepals and petals for selected iris species. **(A)** Within each species, there is a generally direct correlation between sepal length and sepal width. **(B)** There is a strong direct correlation between petal length and petal width that appears colinear among species. **(C)** All species exhibited moderately variable sepal length with *virginica* having the longest sepals on average*. **(D)** The species *setosa* measured the shortest petals with highest precision, with *versicolor* and *virginica* having comparatively more variable and longer petals* (*significant difference using two-tailed t-test).
