### Writing figure captions 

Figure captions often accompany data visualizations in publications, whether those are in scientific journals or in popular media. They help readers understand and interpret the figure. With scientific journals, readers, especially if they are well-versed in the topic of the paper they are reading, will often skip the main text altogether and go straight to the figures to get the main gist of the conclusions. 

The main guideline when writing figure captions is that the figure, along with the caption should be standalone. This means that the reader should be able to understand what the figure is trying to say without refering to the main text. 

While individual publications may have specific policies on what should and should not be included in a figure caption, there are some general guidelines that help ensure the caption is being used effectively for communication: 
- A short title with the main conclusion of the figure.
- A brief description of methods that generated the data shown in the figure. This includes both experimental methods and any subsequent statistical or mathematical methods that were used to analyze and present the data. 
- Relevant statistical information such as sample size, statistical test, etc. 
- Explanations of any abbreviations used in the figure or any data encodings that are not explained by figure legends. 


### Exercise

This is a modified version of the figure we generated in one of our previous classes. Write a caption for this figure with your group. Note, star indicate significant difference using a two-sided t-test.

*This could be a caption*

You can use the template in `code/day7/template.md` to write your caption. Remember to copy the file and rename it before modifying it to avoid conflicts in the repo.
